Brief
-----
You must create a wedding guestbook using Symfony 2 and Doctrine ORM with a backend management system to allow administrators to add/delete weddings and guestbook entries.

You must satisfy the following stories
- As the bride and groom, I must have a personalised link to send to my guests where they can sign my guestbook
- As a guest, I must be able to submit my message for a specific wedding and upload a photo of me
- As an administrator, I must be able to create a wedding for my client and send them a link that they can share with their guests to sign the guest book

To help you out we have designed the ORM for you which can be found below.
